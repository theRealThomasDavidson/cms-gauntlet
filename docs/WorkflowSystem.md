# Workflow System Documentation

## Overview
The workflow system allows for the creation and management of customizable workflows for ticket processing. Each workflow consists of stages that tickets can move through, with optional hooks for automation at each stage.

## Components

### Workflows
- **Purpose**: Define the overall process for handling tickets
- **Properties**:
  - Name
  - Description
  - Active status
  - Creation metadata

### Stages
- **Purpose**: Define individual steps in a workflow
- **Properties**:
  - Name
  - Description
  - Start/End flags
  - Next/Previous stage links
  - Creation metadata

### Hooks
- **Purpose**: Automate actions when tickets enter stages
- **Types**:
  - Email notifications
  - System notifications
  - Webhooks
  - Automatic assignments
- **Configuration**: JSON-based configuration for flexibility

## Database Structure

### Tables
1. `workflows`: Main workflow definitions
2. `workflow_stages`: Individual stages within workflows
3. `workflow_stage_hooks`: Automation hooks attached to stages

### Relationships
- Workflows -> Stages: One-to-many
- Stages -> Hooks: One-to-many
- Stages -> Stages: Self-referential for next/prev links

## Usage

### Creating a Workflow
1. Define the workflow name and description
2. Add stages in the desired order
3. Configure stage properties (start/end flags)
4. Link stages in sequence
5. Add automation hooks as needed

### Managing Workflows
- Toggle workflow active status
- Edit workflow properties
- Modify stage order
- Add/remove stages
- Configure stage hooks

### Stage Transitions
- Stages are linked in sequence
- Each stage can reference next/previous stages
- Transitions maintain data integrity
- Hooks execute during transitions

## Security

### Access Control
- Workflows are organization-scoped
- Role-based access control:
  - Admins: Full access
  - Agents: View and use workflows
  - Users: View assigned workflow stages

### Data Protection
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Cascading deletes for cleanup
- Audit trails via timestamps

## Future Enhancements
1. Conditional transitions
2. Advanced hook types
3. Stage templates
4. Workflow versioning
5. Analytics and reporting
